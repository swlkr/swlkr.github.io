    <h1 id="ruby-on-rails-conceputal-compression-is-a-lie">Ruby on Rails&rsquo; Conceputal Compression is a Lie</h1>
<p>One of rails&rsquo; core things is <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/conceptual-compression-means-beginners-dont-need-to-know-sql-hallelujah/">conceptual compression</a>.</p>
<p>That is a lie.</p>
<p>When I first got into web development around ~2009, it was two years after I had graduated with a degree in computer engineering, so you could say it was a career change. The hot framework of the day was ruby on rails, so I attempted to learn it. Keep in mind I didn&rsquo;t know what SQL was or even what HTTP was, I was fresh out of college, with at most systems level programming knowledge, more FPGA knowledge than programming really. Higher level languages eluded me.</p>
<p>It was an uphill battle learning ruby and rails first instead of sql, http, html, css and javascript.</p>
<p>I only <em>got</em> rails after I went back and learned the fundamentals first (especially sql). Rails does help you automate a bunch of things that may be tedious, but you have to know what those tedious things are first.</p>
<p>My advice to anyone starting out today, learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>sql (via sqlite)</li>
<li>tcp</li>
<li>http</li>
<li>html</li>
<li>css</li>
<li>javascript</li>
</ul>
<p>no frameworks.</p>
<p>Your future self will thank you.</p>

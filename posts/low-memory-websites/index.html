    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on my second home grown janet web framework so I can run multiple websites on a single raspberry pi in my closet.</p>
<p>My first web framework in this vein (which I&rsquo;m still working on) is <a href="https://github.com/joy-framework/joy">joy</a>.</p>
<p>So, you know go smash that star button on github or something.</p>
<p>This next web framework does a lot less. It doesn&rsquo;t have database stuff built in, you can&rsquo;t control the middleware very well, and it requires a lot less typing than joy. You can also write everything in one file if you want. It’s a very dynamic framework that leans heavily on macros and global variables and does some things that are probably frowned upon, but oh well. Let’s take a look:</p>
<pre><code>(use trout)

(route/get &quot;/&quot;
  &quot;hello world&quot;)

(server/start 8000)
</code></pre>
<p>That’s the whole thing. You don’t have to write any other code to have a working web server. That brings it down to 4 lines of code for a very basic plaintext serving website. Pretty cool. Of course that’s not super useful, it would be better if the thing could actually do something useful like submit a form with a csrf token:</p>
<pre><code>(use trout)

(enable :sessions)
(enable :csrf-tokens)

(def todos/new
 (route/get &quot;/todos/new&quot;
   (let [errors (request :errors)]
     (form {:method &quot;POST&quot; :action &quot;/todos&quot;}
       [:input {:type &quot;text&quot; :name &quot;name&quot;}]
       [:div (errors :name)]))))

(route/post &quot;/todos&quot;
  (if (body :name)
     (redirect &quot;/&quot;)
     (todos/new (put-in request [:errors :name] &quot;Name can’t be blank&quot;))))
</code></pre>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit more going on here the one thing that stands out is that the html has a <code>(form)</code> function that creates a hidden input with a csrf token that gets encrypted and stored in a cookie, this also assumes an environment variable named <code>ENCRYPTION_KEY</code> that relies on <a href="https://github.com/joy-framework/cipher">cipher</a> for encryption/decryption. That takes care of that. Oh the cookie is also set with SameSite=Lax; HttpOnly; so that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>One more thing that allows you to do some interesting things like auth are before filters:</p>
<pre><code>(route/before &quot;/&quot;
  (when-let [id (get-in session [:account :id])
             account (db/find :account id)]
    (put request :account account)))
</code></pre>
<p>This bit of code runs before all routes that begin with <code>/</code> (so all routes) and sets the current account in the request var if there is one in the session cookie.</p>
<p>You can check the account in a route like this:</p>
<pre><code>(route/get &quot;/requires-account&quot;
  (when (request :account)
    [:div &quot;You're logged in!&quot;]))
</code></pre>
<p>This will either return <code>nil</code> from <code>when</code> which will go on to return a 404 response or return a div with &ldquo;You&rsquo;re logged in!&quot;. One line to check if someone is authenticated or not, pretty nifty.</p>
<p>There are a few other things I&rsquo;m looking at stealing from <a href="https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra">sinatra</a> and a few more things that will be new, but the idea is to keep the scope super small and see how fast (if it is any faster in the end) I can make new websites and how little memory they use in &ldquo;production&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are a few more things related to middleware like layouts and built in <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">turbolinks</a> support that I&rsquo;ll get to in a more in depth post. Oh and also <code>trout</code> is a working name and it&rsquo;s not open source yet, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out ways to make website development even faster.</p>
